INSIGHT/TODO: A release doesn't really contain a requirement, but rather a claim to address a requirement.
What, exactly, does that mean?  Well, it probably means a claim that the requirement is moved into a
'fixed/closed' state by the code changes in the release.  However, cannot requirements be reopened?
So, as we saw at Pearson, this function needs to reconcile against the current state of the requirements
to 'validate' the claim.

This seems to imply mutability on the requirement, but perhaps not.  Perhaps we model the state
change itself, i.e. a CompletedRequirement, and search for those.  If a requirement is completed, this
state change produces a new value to represent the new state, with a reference to the old value.
