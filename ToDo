-- Things TODO


-- Create concept of integration component
---- When deploying an integration component, we deploy its dependencies if not already present
-- Add concept of Scm file revision
-- Model 'phase' / state transitions
-- Deal with requirements that have been reopened
-- Change how changes are carried by releases/components.  Something is wrong as it is currently
--   possible to have a release whose 'last change' is not contained by its components' scm root dir.
---- Is the 'contained by' metaphor too much of a strain?
-- Can more than one release of a single component exist be deployed in an environment?
---- Can more than one release of a single component be part of an integration component?
-- Undeploying
-- Consider moving 'questions' into the pipeline
-- Consider type-level programming for further constraint enforcement
-- Deal with pairing, i.e. multiple users related to a change?
-- Teams not modeled?
